Internship Task Report

Objective:
Learn to discover open ports on devices in the local network to understand network exposure.

Tools Used:

Nmap: For network discovery and port scanning.
Wireshark: For observing live packets during the scan.

Steps Performed:

1. Verified the system’s local IP using 'ipconfig' — IPv4: 192.168.2.20

2. Identified the network range: 192.168.2.0/24

3. Ran a ping scan to discover active devices using:
       nmap -Pn -sn 192.168.2.0/24
  
4. Found that the active host was 192.168.2.20

5. Conducted a TCP SYN scan to identify open ports:
       nmap -sS 192.168.2.20
  
6. Observed open ports and services on that host.

  Results:

| Port    | State | Service        |
| ------- | ----- | -------------- |
| 135/tcp | open  | msrpc          |
| 139/tcp | open  | netbios-ssn    |
| 445/tcp | open  | microsoft-ds   |
| 902/tcp | open  | iss-realsecure |
| 912/tcp | open  | apex-mesh      |

Interpretation:
The scan detected several open ports commonly used by Windows systems:

* Ports 135, 139, 445 indicate file sharing and RPC services.
* Ports 902 and 912 are related to VMware services, meaning virtualization software is active.
  These open ports show potential network exposure points — attackers could exploit them if not properly secured.
  In a secure setup, unnecessary ports should be disabled, and firewalls configured to limit access.

Conclusion:
Nmap successfully identified open ports on the local machine, demonstrating how network scanning helps assess security exposure within a LAN. This exercise enhanced understanding of active services, network enumeration, and basic vulnerability detection.
